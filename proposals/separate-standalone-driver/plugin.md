## Mock Implementation of Argo Workflow Executor Plugin

According to the [documentation](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/executor_plugins/), an Argo Workflow plugin is a sidecar container that runs in the agent pod. The agent pod is created once for each workflow.

### terminology
- kfp-driver-server â€” the KFP [driver](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/backend/src/v2/driver) component extracted from the workflow pod and deployed as a global HTTP/gRPC server.
- driver-plugin - our implementation of the Executor plugin

*One limitation is that the service account token is not mounted into the sidecar container, which means it cannot interact with the Kubernetes API. This is required for drivers.*
As a result, driver-plugin implementations should merely act as a proxy between the global kfp-driver-server and the Argo Workflow controller.

### Prerequisites
- According to the [configuration](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/executor_plugins/#configuration) ARGO_EXECUTOR_PLUGINS should be set to true 
- Add additional [workflow RBAC](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/http-template/#argo-agent-rbac) for the agent

1. Implement the driver plugin that simply proxies requests from the workflow controller to the kfp-driver-server and back. Check the mock [implementation](src/driver-plugin)
2. Build the image for the driver plugin.
3. Create the [yaml description](src/driver-plugin/plugin.yaml) of the plugin 
4. [Create](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/argo_executor-plugin_build/) the configmap by executing  ```argo executor-plugin build .``` in the yaml description folder from the step 3 
5. Apply the created ConfigMap to the workflow-controller Kubernetes namespace.

After that, you will be able to reference the corresponding driver plugin in your Argo Workflow using:
```yaml
plugin:
    driver-plugin:
    ...
```
