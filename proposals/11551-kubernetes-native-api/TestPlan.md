| **Test Case**                                                                     | **Test Steps**                                        | **Expected Result**                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (K8s mode) Create pipeline and a pipeline version using CRs                       | Match the pipeline and pipeline version (DB vs K8s)   | Pipeline and Pipeline version creation should be successful                                        |
| (K8s mode) Create pipeline and 2 pipeline versions with same spec using CRs       | Match the pipeline and pipeline versions (DB vs K8s)  | Pipeline and Pipeline versions creation should be successful                                       |
