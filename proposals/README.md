# Proposals

Kubeflow uses the KEP process to document large scale changes to the project.

Details on the process (including the KEP template, recommendations, etc.) can be found at
[kubeflow/community/proposals](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/proposals/README.md)

Additionally, please address the following questions and topics in your proposal: 

* Test plan 
* Migration strategy (if applicable)
* Frontend Considerations
  * If this is a backend or SDK related proposal, address any impacts to Frontend
* KFP Local Considerations
  * Address whether this proposal requires changes to the KFP local experience. These are often proposals that introduce SDK features requiring changes to the KFP remote backend.
