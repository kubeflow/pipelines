# Kubeflow Pipelines Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This folder contains all the Architecture Decision Records for Kubeflow Pipelines. Read more about ADRs [here][1].

When adding a new ADR please follow the following instructions: 

1. Use the `template.md` as the basis of your document 
2. The format should be in markdown
3. The file name should follow the format  
4. (Optional) Bring this up in the KFP community call to bring attention to your proposal

It is fine to start with something like a Google Document while you are iterating and asking for feedback, but the 
document should eventually be surfaced as a markdown ADR in the form of a pull request to this repository so it can 
persist alongside the codebase.
