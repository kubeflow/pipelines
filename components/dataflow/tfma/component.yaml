description: |
  Runs Tensorflow Model Analysis. https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/model_analysis/get_started
  TensorFlow Model Analysis allows you to perform model evaluations in the TFX pipeline, and view resultant metrics and plots in a Jupyter notebook. Specifically, it can provide:
  * metrics computed on entire training and holdout dataset, as well as next-day evaluations
  * tracking metrics over time
  * model quality performance on different feature slices
inputs:
- {name: Model,           type: {GcsPath: {path_type: Directory, data_type: Exported TensorFlow models dir}}, description: GCS path to the model which will be evaluated.}
- {name: Evaluation data, type: {GcsPath: {data_type: CSV}},              description: GCS path of eval files.}
- {name: Schema,          type: {GcsPath: {data_type: TFDV schema JSON}}, description: GCS json schema file path.}
- {name: Run mode,        type: String,     default: local,               description: whether to run the job locally or in Cloud Dataflow.}
- {name: GCP project,     type: GcpProject, default: '',                  description: 'The GCP project to run the dataflow job, if running in the `cloud` mode.'}
- {name: Slice columns,   type: String,                                   description: Comma-separated list of columns on which to slice for analysis.}
- {name: Analysis results dir, type: {GcsPath: {path_type: Directory}},   description: GCS or local directory where the analysis results should be written.}
outputs:
- {name: Analysis results dir, type: {GcsPath: {path_type: Directory}},   description: GCS or local directory where the analysis results should were written.}
