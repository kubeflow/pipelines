# This script automated the process to release the component images.
# To run it, find a good release candidate commit SHA from ml-pipeline-staging project,
# and provide a full github COMMIT SHA to the script. E.g.
# ./release.sh 2118baf752d3d30a8e43141165e13573b20d85b8
# The script copies the images from staging to prod, and update the local code.
# You can then send a PR using your local branch.
