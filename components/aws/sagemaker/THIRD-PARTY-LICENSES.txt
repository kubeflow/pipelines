      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited
      to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to
      other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object
      form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright
      notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is
      provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
      that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
      revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,
      as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this
      License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable
      from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
      Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
      version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for
      inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal
      Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the
      purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic,
      verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its

      discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is
      conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
      owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
      behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
   sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
   Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
   this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
   import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to
   those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
   infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
   Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
   If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
   Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
   patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
   License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
   filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
   Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and
   in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
      copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
      distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
      from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include
      a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE
      file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
      Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
      NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the
      Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
      Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
      NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
      License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
      that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from
      the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
      construed as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
      provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
      reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
      Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
      distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
      this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
   Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
   Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without
   any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing
   herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement
   you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except
   as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
   Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
   KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
   warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
   the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
   associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
   in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
   in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
   any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
   to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
   commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
   the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
   or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
   acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
   and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
   obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
   responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
   agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
   liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
   reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. END OF
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS

APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate
notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own
identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be
enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also
recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on
the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier identification
within third-party archives.

** contextlib2; version 0.6.0 -- https://contextlib2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
This is a Jazzband project. By contributing you agree to abide by the
Contributor Code of Conduct and follow the guidelines.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

contextlib2 is a derivative of the contextlib module distributed by the PSF
as part of the Python standard library. According, it is itself redistributed
under the PSF license (reproduced in full below). As the contextlib module
was added only in Python 2.5, the licenses for earlier Python versions are
not applicable and have not been included.

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases that included the contextlib module.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.
