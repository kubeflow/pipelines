# Amazon SageMaker Components for Kubeflow Pipelines

## Summary
With Amazon SageMaker Components for Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP), you can create and monitor training, tuning, endpoint deployment, and batch transform jobs in Amazon SageMaker. By running Kubeflow Pipeline jobs on Amazon SageMaker, you move data processing and training jobs from the Kubernetes cluster to Amazon SageMakerâ€™s machine learning-optimized managed service. The job parameters, status, and outputs from Amazon SageMaker are still accessible from the Kubeflow Pipelines UI.

## Components
Amazon SageMaker Components for Kubeflow Pipelines offer an alternative to launching compute-intensive jobs in Kubernetes and integrate the orchestration benefits of Kubeflow Pipelines. The following Amazon SageMaker components have been created to integrate key SageMaker features into your ML workflows from preparing data, to building, training, and deploying ML models. You can create a Kubeflow Pipeline built entirely using these components, or integrate individual components into your workflow as needed. The components are available in one or two versions. Each version of a component leverages a different backend. For more information on those versions, see [SageMaker Components for Kubeflow Pipelines versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/kubernetes-sagemaker-components-for-kubeflow-pipelines.html#sagemaker-components-versions). 

For an end-to-end tutorial using these components, see [Using Amazon SageMaker Components](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/kubernetes-sagemaker-components-tutorials.html).

For more example pipelines, see [Sample AWS SageMaker Kubeflow Pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/samples/contrib/aws-samples).

There is no additional charge for using Amazon SageMaker Components for Kubeflow Pipelines. You incur charges for any Amazon SageMaker resources you use through these components.
