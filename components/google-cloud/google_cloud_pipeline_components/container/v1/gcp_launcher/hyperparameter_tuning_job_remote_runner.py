  This follows the typical launching logic:
  1. Read if the HP Tuning job already exists in gcp_resources
     - If already exists, jump to step 3 and poll the job status. This happens
       if the launcher container experienced unexpected termination, such as
       preemption
  2. Deserialize the payload into the job spec and create the HP Tuning job
  3. Poll the HP Tuning job status every _POLLING_INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS seconds
     - If the HP Tuning job is succeeded, return succeeded
     - If the HP Tuning job is cancelled/paused, it's an unexpected scenario so
     return failed
     - If the HP Tuning job is running, continue polling the status
  Also retry on ConnectionError up to
  job_remote_runner._CONNECTION_ERROR_RETRY_LIMIT times during the poll.
