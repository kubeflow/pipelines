  """Creates a new text [Dataset](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-
  ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.datasets) and optionally imports
  data into Dataset when `source` and `import_schema_uri` are passed.

  Args:
      display_name: The user-defined name of the Dataset. The name can be up to 128 characters long and can be consist of any UTF-8 characters.
      gcs_source: Google Cloud Storage URI(-s) to the input file(s). May contain wildcards. For more information on wildcards, see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/WildcardNames. For example, `"gs://bucket/file.csv"` or `["gs://bucket/file1.csv", "gs://bucket/file2.csv"]`.
      import_schema_uri: Points to a YAML file stored on Google Cloud Storage describing the import format. Validation will be done against the schema. The schema is defined as an [OpenAPI 3.0.2 Schema Object](https://tinyurl.com/y538mdwt).
      data_item_labels: Labels that will be applied to newly imported DataItems. If an identical DataItem as one being imported already exists in the Dataset, then these labels will be appended to these of the already existing one, and if labels with identical key is imported before, the old label value will be overwritten. If two DataItems are identical in the same import data operation, the labels will be combined and if key collision happens in this case, one of the values will be picked randomly. Two DataItems are considered identical if their content bytes are identical (e.g. image bytes or pdf bytes). These labels will be overridden by Annotation labels specified inside index file refenced by `import_schema_uri`, e.g. jsonl file.
      location: Optional location to retrieve Dataset from.
      labels: Labels with user-defined metadata to organize your Tensorboards. Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed. No more than 64 user labels can be associated with one Tensorboard (System labels are excluded). See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with "aiplatform.googleapis.com/" and are immutable.
      encryption_spec_key_name: The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer managed encryption key used to protect the Dataset. Has the form: `projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key`. The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute resource is created. If set, this Dataset and all sub-resources of this Dataset will be secured by this key. Overrides `encryption_spec_key_name` set in `aiplatform.init`.
      project: Project to retrieve Dataset from. Defaults to the project in which the PipelineJob is run.

  Returns:
      dataset: Instantiated representation of the managed text Datasetresource.
