        Exports data to output dir to GCS.
        Args:
            output_dir (String):
                Required. The Google Cloud Storage location where the output is to
                be written to. In the given directory a new directory will be
                created with name:
                ``export-data-<dataset-display-name>-<timestamp-of-export-call>``
                where timestamp is in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format. All export
                output will be written into that directory. Inside that
                directory, annotations with the same schema will be grouped
                into sub directories which are named with the corresponding
                annotations' schema title. Inside these sub directories, a
                schema.yaml will be created to describe the output format.
                If the uri doesn't end with '/', a '/' will be automatically
                appended. The directory is created if it doesn't exist.
            project (String):
                Required. project to retrieve dataset from.
            location (String):
                Optional location to retrieve dataset from.
        Returns:
            exported_files (Sequence[str]):
                All of the files that are exported in this export operation.
