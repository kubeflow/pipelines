  """Preprocesses BigQuery tables for training or prediction.

  Creates a BigQuery table for training or prediction based on the input tables.
  For training, a primary table is required. Optionally, you can include some
  attribute tables. For prediction, you need to include all the tables that were
  used in the training, plus a plan table.

  Args:
    project: The GCP project id that runs the pipeline.
    input_tables: Serialized Json array that specifies input BigQuery tables and specs.
    preprocessing_bigquery_dataset: Optional BigQuery dataset to save the preprocessing result BigQuery table. If not present, a new dataset will be created by the component.
    location: Optional location for the BigQuery data, default is US.

  Returns:
    preprocess_metadata
