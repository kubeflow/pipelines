name: Wait GCP Resources
description: |
  Receives a GCP Resource, polling the resource status and waits for it to finish.
  Currently this component only support waiting on a DataflowJob resource.

  To use this component, first create a component that outputs a JSON formatted gcp_resources proto, then pass it to the wait component.

  dataflow_python_op = gcpc.v1.dataflow.LaunchPythonOp(
      python_file_path = ...
  )

  dataflow_wait_op = gcpc.v1.wait_gcp_resources.WaitGcp_ResourcesOp(
      gcp_resources = dataflow_python_op.outputs["gcp_resources"]
  )

  For details on how to create a Json serialized gcp_resources proto as output, see
  https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/components/google-cloud/google_cloud_pipeline_components/proto


  Args:
    gcp_resources (str):
        Serialized JSON of gcp_resources proto, indicating the resource to wait on by this component
        For details, see https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/components/google-cloud/google_cloud_pipeline_components/proto

  Returns:
    gcp_resources (str):
        The final result of the gcp resource, including the error information, if exists.
inputs:
- {name: gcp_resources, type: String}
outputs:
- {name: gcp_resources, type: String}
implementation:
  container:
    image: gcr.io/ml-pipeline/google-cloud-pipeline-components:1.0.28
    command: [python3, -u, -m, google_cloud_pipeline_components.container.v1.wait_gcp_resources.launcher]
    args: [
      --type, Wait,
      # project and location are already specified in the input gcp_resources
      --project, '',
      --location, '',
      --payload, {inputValue: gcp_resources},
      --gcp_resources, {outputPath: gcp_resources},
    ]
