  Args:
    display_name: Component display name. Can contain up to 128 UTF-8
      characters.
    machine_type: The type of the machine to provision for the custom job. Must
      be a valid GCE instance type and compatible with the accelerator type.
    image_uri: Docker image URI to use for the custom job.
    args: Arguments to pass to the Docker image.
    accelerator_type: Type of accelerator. By default no accelerator is
      requested.
    accelerator_count: Number of accelerators. By default no accelerators are
      requested.
    encryption_spec_key_name: Customer-managed encryption key. If this is set,

      provided encryption key. Note that this is not supported for TPU at the

  Returns:
