  """A pipeline to compute feature attributions by sampling data for batch explanations.

  This pipeline guarantees support for AutoML Tabular models that contain a
  valid explanation_spec.

  Args:
    location: The GCP region that runs the pipeline components.
    prediction_type: The type of prediction the model is to produce. "classification", "regression", or "forecasting".
    vertex_model: The Vertex model artifact used for batch explanation.
    batch_predict_instances_format: The format in which instances are given, must be one of the Model's supportedInputStorageFormats. For more details about this input config, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.batchPredictionJobs#InputConfig.
    batch_predict_gcs_destination_output_uri: The Google Cloud Storage location of the directory where the output is to be written to. In the given directory a new directory is created. Its name is `prediction-<model-display-name>-<job-create-time>`, where timestamp is in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ ISO-8601 format. Inside of it files `predictions_0001.<extension>`, `predictions_0002.<extension>`, ..., `predictions_N.<extension>` are created where `<extension>` depends on chosen `predictions_format`, and N may equal 0001 and depends on the total number of successfully predicted instances. If the Model has both `instance` and `prediction` schemata defined then each such file contains predictions as per the `predictions_format`. If prediction for any instance failed (partially or completely), then an additional `errors_0001.<extension>`, `errors_0002.<extension>`,..., `errors_N.<extension>` files are created (N depends on total number of failed predictions). These files contain the failed instances, as per their schema, followed by an additional `error` field which as value has `google.rpc.Status` containing only `code` and `message` fields. For more details about this output config, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.batchPredictionJobs#OutputConfig.
    batch_predict_gcs_source_uris: Google Cloud Storage URI(-s) to your instances to run batch prediction on. May contain wildcards. For more information on wildcards, see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/WildcardNames. For more details about this input config, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.batchPredictionJobs#InputConfig.
    batch_predict_bigquery_source_uri: Google BigQuery URI to your instances to run batch prediction on. May contain wildcards. For more details about this input config, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.batchPredictionJobs#InputConfig.
    batch_predict_predictions_format: The format in which Vertex AI gives the predictions. Must be one of the Model's supportedOutputStorageFormats. For more details about this output config, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.batchPredictionJobs#OutputConfig.
    batch_predict_bigquery_destination_output_uri: The BigQuery project location where the output is to be written to. In the given project a new dataset is created with name `prediction_<model-display-name>_<job-create-time>` where is made BigQuery-dataset-name compatible (for example, most special characters become underscores), and timestamp is in YYYY_MM_DDThh_mm_ss_sssZ "based on ISO-8601" format. In the dataset two tables will be created, `predictions`, and `errors`. If the Model has both `instance` and `prediction` schemata defined then the tables have columns as follows: The `predictions` table contains instances for which the prediction succeeded, it has columns as per a concatenation of the Model's instance and prediction schemata. The `errors` table contains rows for which the prediction has failed, it has instance columns, as per the instance schema, followed by a single "errors" column, which as values has `google.rpc.Status` represented as a STRUCT, and containing only `code` and `message`.  For more details about this output config, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.batchPredictionJobs#OutputConfig.
    batch_predict_machine_type: The type of machine for running batch prediction on dedicated resources. If the Model supports DEDICATED_RESOURCES this config may be provided (and the job will use these resources). If the Model doesn't support AUTOMATIC_RESOURCES, this config must be provided. For more details about the BatchDedicatedResources, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.batchPredictionJobs#BatchDedicatedResources. For more details about the machine spec, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/MachineSpec
    batch_predict_starting_replica_count: The number of machine replicas used at the start of the batch operation. If not set, Vertex AI decides starting number, not greater than `max_replica_count`. Only used if `machine_type` is set.
    batch_predict_max_replica_count: The maximum number of machine replicas the batch operation may be scaled to. Only used if `machine_type` is set.
    batch_predict_explanation_metadata: Explanation metadata configuration for this BatchPredictionJob. Can be specified only if `generate_explanation` is set to `True`. This value overrides the value of `Model.explanation_metadata`. All fields of `explanation_metadata` are optional in the request. If a field of the `explanation_metadata` object is not populated, the corresponding field of the `Model.explanation_metadata` object is inherited. For more details, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/ExplanationSpec#explanationmetadata.
    batch_predict_explanation_parameters: Parameters to configure explaining for Model's predictions. Can be specified only if `generate_explanation` is set to `True`. This value overrides the value of `Model.explanation_parameters`. All fields of `explanation_parameters` are optional in the request. If a field of the `explanation_parameters` object is not populated, the corresponding field of the `Model.explanation_parameters` object is inherited. For more details, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/ExplanationSpec#ExplanationParameters.
    batch_predict_explanation_data_sample_size: Desired size to downsample the input dataset that will then be used for batch explanation.
    batch_predict_accelerator_type: The type of accelerator(s) that may be attached to the machine as per `batch_predict_accelerator_count`. Only used if `batch_predict_machine_type` is set. For more details about the machine spec, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/MachineSpec
    batch_predict_accelerator_count: The number of accelerators to attach to the `batch_predict_machine_type`. Only used if `batch_predict_machine_type` is set.
    dataflow_machine_type: The Dataflow machine type for evaluation components.
    dataflow_max_num_workers: The max number of Dataflow workers for evaluation components.
    dataflow_disk_size_gb: Dataflow worker's disk size in GB for evaluation components.
    dataflow_service_account: Custom service account to run Dataflow jobs.
    dataflow_subnetwork: Dataflow's fully qualified subnetwork name, when empty the default subnetwork will be used. Example: https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-networks#example_network_and_subnetwork_specifications
    dataflow_use_public_ips: Specifies whether Dataflow workers use public IP addresses.
    encryption_spec_key_name:  Customer-managed encryption key options. If set, resources created by this pipeline will be encrypted with the provided encryption key. Has the form: `projects/my-project/locations/my-location/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key`. The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute resource is created.
    force_runner_mode: Indicate the runner mode to use forcely. Valid options are `Dataflow` and `DirectRunner`.
    project: The GCP project that runs the pipeline components. Defaults to the project in which the PipelineJob is run.

  Returns:
    A system.Metrics artifact with feature attributions.
