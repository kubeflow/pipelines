  """LLM Text Generation Evaluation pipeline.

  This pipeline supports evaluating large language models, publisher or managed
  models, performing the following generative tasks: `summarization`, `question-answering`, and `text-generation`.

  Args:
    project: The GCP project that runs the pipeline components.
    location: The GCP region that runs the pipeline components.
    batch_predict_gcs_source_uris: Google Cloud Storage URI(-s) to your instances data to run batch prediction on. The instances data should also contain the ground truth (target) data, used for evaluation. May contain wildcards. For more information on wildcards, see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/WildcardNames. For more details about this input config, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.batchPredictionJobs#InputConfig.
    batch_predict_gcs_destination_output_uri: The Google Cloud Storage location of the directory where the output is to be written to.
    model_name: The Model name used to run evaluation. Must be a publisher Model or a managed Model sharing the same ancestor location. Starting this job has no impact on any existing deployments of the Model and their resources.
    evaluation_task: The task that the large language model will be evaluated on. The evaluation component computes a set of metrics relevant to that specific task. Currently supported tasks are: `summarization`, `question-answering`, `text-generation`.
    batch_predict_instances_format: The format in which instances are given, must be one of the Model's supportedInputStorageFormats. Only "jsonl" is currently supported. For more details about this input config, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.batchPredictionJobs#InputConfig.
    batch_predict_predictions_format: The format in which Vertex AI gives the predictions. Must be one of the Model's supportedOutputStorageFormats. Only "jsonl" is currently supported. For more details about this output config, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.batchPredictionJobs#OutputConfig.
    machine_type: The machine type of this custom job. If not set, defaulted to `e2-highmem-16`. More details: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-resource
    service_account: Sets the default service account for workload run-as account. The service account running the pipeline (https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/configure-project#service-account) submitting jobs must have act-as permission on this run-as account. If unspecified, the Vertex AI Custom Code Service Agent(https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#service-agents) for the CustomJob's project.
    network: The full name of the Compute Engine network to which the job should be peered. For example, `projects/12345/global/networks/myVPC`. Format is of the form `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}`. Where `{project}` is a project number, as in `12345`, and `{network}` is a network name, as in `myVPC`. To specify this field, you must have already configured VPC Network Peering for Vertex AI (https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/vpc-peering). If left unspecified, the job is not peered with any network.
    encryption_spec_key_name:  Customer-managed encryption key options. If set, resources created by this pipeline will be encrypted with the provided encryption key. Has the form: `projects/my-project/locations/my-location/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key`. The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute resource is created.
    evaluation_display_name: The display name of the uploaded evaluation resource to the Vertex AI model.

  Returns:
    evaluation_metrics: Metrics Artifact for LLM Text Generation.
    evaluation_resource_name: If run on an user's managed VertexModel, the imported evaluation resource name. Empty if run on a publisher model.
