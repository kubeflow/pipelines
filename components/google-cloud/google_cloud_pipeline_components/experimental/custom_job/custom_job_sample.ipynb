    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use the `run_as_vertex_ai_custom_job` wrapper to convert any component to run it as a Vertex AI custom job. This allows users to take advantage of the vertical and horizontal scaling for computation heavy tasks on Vertex AI. This requires that the underlying component has built in support distributed computation.
