    Preprocesses BigQuery tables for training or prediction.

    Creates a BigQuery table for training or prediction based on the input tables.
    For training, a primary table is required. Optionally, you can include some
    attribute tables. For prediction, you need to include all the tables that were
    used in the training, plus a plan table.

    Args:
      project (str): 
          The GCP project id that runs the pipeline.
      input_tables (str):
          Serialized Json array that specifies input BigQuery tables and specs.
      preprocessing_bigquery_dataset (str):
          Optional BigQuery dataset to save the preprocessing result BigQuery table.
          If not present, a new dataset will be created by the component.

    Returns:
      preprocess_metadata (str)
inputs:
- {name: project, type: String}
- {name: input_tables, type: String}
- {name: preprocessing_bigquery_dataset, type: String}
outputs:
- {name: preprocess_metadata, type: String}
implementation:
