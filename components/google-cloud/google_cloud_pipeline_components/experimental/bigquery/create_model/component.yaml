description: |
  Launch a BigQuery create model job and waits for it to finish.

    Args:
        project (str):
            Required. Project to run BigQuery model creation job.
        location (Optional[str]):
            Location of the job to create the BigQuery model. If not set,
            default to `US` multi-region.

            For more details, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations#specifying_your_location
        query (str):
            Required. SQL query text to execute. Only standard SQL is supported.

            If query are both specified in here and in job_configuration_query,
            the value in here will override the other one.
        query_parameters (Optional[Sequence]):
            jobs.query parameters for standard SQL queries.

            If query_parameters are both specified in here and in job_configuration_query,
            the value in here will override the other one.
        job_configuration_query (Optional[dict]):
            A json formatted string describing the rest of the job configuration.

            For more details, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#JobConfigurationQuery
        labels (Optional[dict]):
            The labels associated with this job. You can use these to organize and group your jobs.
            Label keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters, can only containlowercase
            letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are
            allowed. Label values are optional. Label keys must start with a letter and each label
            in the list must have a different key.

            Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.
        encryption_spec_key_name(Optional[List[str]]):
            Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect
            destination BigQuery table. The BigQuery Service Account associated with
            your project requires access to this encryption key.

            If encryption_spec_key_name are both specified in here and in job_configuration_query,
            the value in here will override the other one.
    Returns:
        model (google.BQMLModel):
          Describes the model which is created.
        gcp_resources (str):
            Serialized gcp_resources proto tracking the BigQuery job.
            For more details, see https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/components/google-cloud/google_cloud_pipeline_components/proto/README.md.
