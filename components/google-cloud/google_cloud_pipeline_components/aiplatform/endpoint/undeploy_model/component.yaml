    Undeploys a Google Cloud Vertex DeployedModel within the Endpoint.
    For more details, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.endpoints/deployModel.

    Args:
        model (google.VertexModel):
            Required. The model that was deployed to the Endpoint.
        endpoint (google.VertexEndpoint):
            Required. The endpoint for the DeployedModel to be undeployed from.
        traffic_split (Optional[Dict[str, int]]):
            If this field is provided, then the Endpoint's trafficSplit will be overwritten with it.
            If last DeployedModel is being undeployed from the Endpoint, the
            [Endpoint.traffic_split] will always end up empty when this call returns.
            A DeployedModel will be successfully undeployed only if it doesn't have any traffic
            assigned to it when this method executes, or if this field unassigns any traffic to it.

    Returns:
        gcp_resources (str):
            Serialized gcp_resources proto tracking the undeploy model's long running operation.

            For more details, see https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/components/google-cloud/google_cloud_pipeline_components/proto/README.md.
