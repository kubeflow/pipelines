        Runs the training job and returns a model.
        If training on a Vertex AI dataset, you can use one of the following split configurations:
            Data fraction splits:
            Any of ``training_fraction_split``, ``validation_fraction_split`` and
            ``test_fraction_split`` may optionally be provided, they must sum to up to 1. If
            the provided ones sum to less than 1, the remainder is assigned to sets as
            decided by Vertex AI. If none of the fractions are set, by default roughly 80%
            of data will be used for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for test.
            Data filter splits:
            Assigns input data to training, validation, and test sets
            based on the given filters, data pieces not matched by any
            filter are ignored. Currently only supported for Datasets
            containing DataItems.
            If any of the filters in this message are to match nothing, then
            they can be set as '-' (the minus sign).
            Supported only for unstructured Datasets.
        Args:
            dataset (datasets.TextDataset):
                Required. The dataset within the same Project from which data will be used to train the Model. The
                Dataset must use schema compatible with Model being trained,
                and what is compatible should be described in the used
                TrainingPipeline's [training_task_definition]
                [google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.TrainingPipeline.training_task_definition].
            training_fraction_split (Float):
                Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to train
                the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
            validation_fraction_split (Float):
                Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to validate
                the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
            test_fraction_split (Float):
                Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to evaluate
                the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
            model_display_name (String):
                Optional. The display name of the managed Vertex AI Model.
                The name can be up to 128 characters long and can consist
                of any UTF-8 characters.
                If not provided upon creation, the job's display_name is used.
            model_labels (JsonObject):
                Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to
                organize your Models.
                Label keys and values can be no longer than 64
                characters (Unicode codepoints), can only
                contain lowercase letters, numeric characters,
                underscores and dashes. International characters
                are allowed.
                See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information
                and examples of labels.
            display_name (String):
                Required. The user-defined name of this TrainingPipeline.
            prediction_type (String):
                The type of prediction the Model is to produce, one of:
                    "classification" - A classification model analyzes text data and
                        returns a list of categories that apply to the text found in the data.
                        Vertex AI offers both single-label and multi-label text classification models.
                    "extraction" - An entity extraction model inspects text data
                        for known entities referenced in the data and
                        labels those entities in the text.
                    "sentiment" - A sentiment analysis model inspects text data and identifies the
                        prevailing emotional opinion within it, especially to determine a writer's attitude
                        as positive, negative, or neutral.
            multi_label (Boolean):
                Required and only applicable for text classification task. If false, a single-label (multi-class) Model will be trained (i.e.
                assuming that for each text snippet just up to one annotation may be
                applicable). If true, a multi-label Model will be trained (i.e.
                assuming that for each text snippet multiple annotations may be
                applicable).
            sentiment_max (Integer):
                Required and only applicable for sentiment task. A sentiment is expressed as an integer
                ordinal, where higher value means a more
                positive sentiment. The range of sentiments that
                will be used is between 0 and sentimentMax
                (inclusive on both ends), and all the values in
                the range must be represented in the dataset
                before a model can be created.
                Only the Annotations with this sentimentMax will
                be used for training. sentimentMax value must be
                between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
            project (String):
                Required. project to retrieve dataset from.
            location (String):
                Optional location to retrieve dataset from.
            labels (JsonObject):
                Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to
                organize TrainingPipelines.
                Label keys and values can be no longer than 64
                characters (Unicode codepoints), can only
                contain lowercase letters, numeric characters,
                underscores and dashes. International characters
                are allowed.
                See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information
                and examples of labels.
            training_encryption_spec_key_name (Optional[String]):
                Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer
                managed encryption key used to protect the training pipeline. Has the
                form:
                ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``.
                The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute
                resource is created.
                If set, this TrainingPipeline will be secured by this key.
                Note: Model trained by this TrainingPipeline is also secured
                by this key if ``model_to_upload`` is not set separately.
                Overrides encryption_spec_key_name set in aiplatform.init.
            model_encryption_spec_key_name (Optional[String]):
                Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer
                managed encryption key used to protect the model. Has the
                form:
                ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``.
                The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute
                resource is created.
                If set, the trained Model will be secured by this key.
                Overrides encryption_spec_key_name set in aiplatform.init.
        Returns:
            model: The trained Vertex AI Model resource.
