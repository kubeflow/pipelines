        Runs the training job and returns a model.
        If training on a Vertex AI dataset, you can use one of the following split configurations:
            Data fraction splits:
            Any of ``training_fraction_split``, ``validation_fraction_split`` and
            ``test_fraction_split`` may optionally be provided, they must sum to up to 1. If
            the provided ones sum to less than 1, the remainder is assigned to sets as
            decided by Vertex AI. If none of the fractions are set, by default roughly 80%
            of data will be used for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for test.
            Predefined splits:
            Assigns input data to training, validation, and test sets based on the value of a provided key.
            If using predefined splits, ``predefined_split_column_name`` must be provided.
            Supported only for tabular Datasets.
            Timestamp splits:
            Assigns input data to training, validation, and test sets
            based on a provided timestamps. The youngest data pieces are
            assigned to training set, next to validation set, and the oldest
            to the test set.
            Supported only for tabular Datasets.
        Args:
            dataset (google.VertexDataset):
                Required. The dataset within the same Project from which data will be used to train the Model. The

                Optional. The key is a name of one of the Dataset's data
                columns. The value of the key (either the label's value or
                value in the column) must be one of {``TRAIN``,
                ``VALIDATE``, ``TEST``}, and it defines to which set the
                given piece of data is assigned. If for a piece of data the
                key is not present or has an invalid value, that piece is
                ignored by the pipeline.
                Supported only for tabular and time series Datasets.
            timestamp_split_column_name (String):
                Optional. The key is a name of one of the Dataset's data

                `time-offset` = `"Z"` (e.g. 1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z). If for a
                piece of data the key is not present or has an invalid value,
                that piece is ignored by the pipeline.
                Supported only for tabular and time series Datasets.
                This parameter must be used with training_fraction_split,
                validation_fraction_split, and test_fraction_split.
            weight_column (String):
                Optional. Name of the column that should be used as the weight column.
                Higher values in this column give more importance to the row
                during Model training. The column must have numeric values between 0 and
                10000 inclusively, and 0 value means that the row is ignored.
                If the weight column field is not set, then all rows are assumed to have
                equal weight of 1. This column must be available at forecast.

                [data_granularity_unit] and [data_granularity_count] fields. When not provided uses the
                default value of 0 which means the model sets each series context window to be 0 (also
                known as "cold start"). Inclusive.
            export_evaluated_data_items (Boolean):
                Whether to export the test set predictions to a BigQuery table.
                If False, then the export is not performed.
            export_evaluated_data_items_bigquery_destination_uri (String):
                Optional. URI of desired destination BigQuery table for exported test set predictions.

                ``bq://<project_id>:<dataset_id>:<table>``
                If not specified, then results are exported to the following auto-created BigQuery
                table:
                ``<project_id>:export_evaluated_examples_<model_name>_<yyyy_MM_dd'T'HH_mm_ss_SSS'Z'>.evaluated_examples``

                table exists, then the training job will fail.
                Applies only if [export_evaluated_data_items] is True and
                [export_evaluated_data_items_bigquery_destination_uri] is specified.
            quantiles (JsonArray):
                Quantiles to use for the `minimize-quantile-loss`
                [AutoMLForecastingTrainingJob.optimization_objective]. This argument is required in

                hours i.e. 1,000 value in this field means 1 node hour.
                The training cost of the model will not exceed this budget. The final
                cost will be attempted to be close to the budget, though may end up
                being (even) noticeably smaller - at the backend's discretion. This
                especially may happen when further model training ceases to provide
                any improvements.
                If the budget is set to a value known to be insufficient to train a
                Model for the given training set, the training won't be attempted and
                will error.

                Optional. When set to True, the newly uploaded model version will
                automatically have alias "default" included. Subsequent uses of

                use this "default" version.
                When set to False, the "default" alias will not be moved.
                Actions targeting the model version produced by this job will need
                to specifically reference this version by ID or alias.
                New model uploads, i.e. version 1, will always be "default" aliased.
            model_version_aliases (JsonArray):
                Optional. User provided version aliases so that the model version
                uploaded by this job can be referenced via alias instead of
                auto-generated version ID. A default version alias will be created
                for the first version of the model.

                ``department`` for a hierarchy of products. If multiple columns
                are specified, time series will be grouped by their combined
                values, ex. (``blue``, ``large``) for ``color`` and ``size``, up
                to 5 columns are accepted. If no group columns are specified,
                all time series are considered to be part of the same group.

                window from that row.
            window_stride_length (Integer):
                Optional. Step length used to generate input examples. Every

            window_max_count (Integer):
                Optional. Number of rows that should be used to generate input
                examples. If the total row count is larger than this number, the

                When creating transformation for BigQuery Struct column, the column
                should be flattened using "." as the delimiter. Only columns with no child
                should have a transformation.
                If an input column has no transformations on it, such a column is
                ignored by the training, except for the targetColumn, which should have
                no transformations defined on.
                Only one of column_transformations or column_specs should be passed.
            column_transformations (List[Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]]):
                Optional. Transformations to apply to the input columns (i.e. columns other
                than the targetColumn). Each transformation may produce multiple
                result values from the column's value, and all are used for training.
                When creating transformation for BigQuery Struct column, the column
                should be flattened using "." as the delimiter. Only columns with no child
                should have a transformation.
                If an input column has no transformations on it, such a column is
                ignored by the training, except for the targetColumn, which should have
                no transformations defined on.
                Only one of column_transformations or column_specs should be passed.
                Consider using column_specs as column_transformations will be deprecated eventually.

                managed encryption key used to protect the model. Has the
                form:
                ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``.
                The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute
                resource is created.
                If set, the trained Model will be secured by this key.
                Overrides encryption_spec_key_name set in aiplatform.init.
            additional_experiments (List[str]):
                Optional. Additional experiment flags for the time series forcasting training.
        Returns:
            model: The trained Vertex AI Model resource or None if training did not
                produce a Vertex AI Model.
