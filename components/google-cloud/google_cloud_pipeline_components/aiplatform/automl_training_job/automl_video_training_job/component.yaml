description: |
        Runs the AutoML Video training job and returns a model.
        If training on a Vertex AI dataset, you can use one of the following split configurations:
            Data fraction splits:
            ``training_fraction_split``, and ``test_fraction_split`` may optionally
            be provided, they must sum to up to 1. If none of the fractions are set,
            by default roughly 80% of data will be used for training, and 20% for test.
            Data filter splits:
            Assigns input data to training, validation, and test sets
            based on the given filters, data pieces not matched by any
            filter are ignored. Currently only supported for Datasets
            containing DataItems.
            If any of the filters in this message are to match nothing, then
            they can be set as '-' (the minus sign).
            Supported only for unstructured Datasets.
        Args:
            dataset (datasets.VideoDataset):
                Required. The dataset within the same Project from which data will be used to train the Model. The
                Dataset must use schema compatible with Model being trained,
                and what is compatible should be described in the used
                TrainingPipeline's [training_task_definition]
                [google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.TrainingPipeline.training_task_definition].
                For tabular Datasets, all their data is exported to
                training, to pick and choose from.
            training_fraction_split (Float):
                Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to train
                the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
            test_fraction_split (Float):
                Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to evaluate
                the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
            model_display_name (String):
                Optional. The display name of the managed Vertex AI Model. The name
                can be up to 128 characters long and can be consist of any UTF-8
                characters. If not provided upon creation, the job's display_name is used.
            model_labels (JsonObject):
                Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to
                organize your Models.
                Label keys and values can be no longer than 64
                characters (Unicode codepoints), can only

                underscores and dashes. International characters
                are allowed.

                        multiple objects in shots and segments. You can use these
                        models to track objects in your videos according to your
                        own pre-defined, custom labels.
