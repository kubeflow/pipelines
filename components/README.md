# Components for Kubeflow Pipelines

Kubeflow Pipelines system orchestrates pipeline graphs of containerized command-line programs.
Components are the building blocks of pipelines.
Component definition files describe component interface (inputs and outputs) and implementation (how to call the containerized program).
Users can load components with KFP SDK, instantiate the components and compose them in a pipeline graph.
