# Details
## Intended use
Use this component to submit a training job to AI Platform from a Kubeflow pipeline. 

## Runtime arguments

## Cautions & requirements

To use the component, you must:

*   Set up a cloud environment by following this [guide](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/getting-started-training-prediction#setup).
*   The component can authenticate to GCP. Refer to [Authenticating Pipelines to GCP](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/authentication-pipelines/) for details.
*   Grant the following access to the Kubeflow user service account: 
    *   Read access to the Cloud Storage buckets which contain the input data, packages, or Docker images.
    *   Write access to the Cloud Storage bucket of the output directory.

## Detailed description

The component builds the [TrainingInput](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.jobs#TrainingInput) payload and submits a job via the [AI Platform REST API](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.jobs).

The steps to use the component in a pipeline are:


1.  Install the Kubeflow pipeline's SDK:

    ```python
    %%capture --no-stderr

    KFP_PACKAGE = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/ml-pipeline/release/0.1.14/kfp.tar.gz'
    !pip3 install $KFP_PACKAGE --upgrade
    ```

2. Load the component using the Kubeflow pipeline's SDK:

    ```python
    import kfp.components as comp

    mlengine_train_op = comp.load_component_from_url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/pipelines/01a23ae8672d3b18e88adf3036071496aca3552d/components/gcp/ml_engine/train/component.yaml')
    help(mlengine_train_op)
    ```
### Sample
The following sample code works in an IPython notebook or directly in Python code.

In this sample, you use the code from the [census estimator sample](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/tree/master/census/estimator) to train a model on AI Platform. To upload the code to AI Platform, package the Python code and upload it to a Cloud Storage bucket. 

Note: You must have read and write permissions on the bucket that you use as the working directory.

#### Set sample parameters

```python
# Required parameters
PROJECT_ID = '<Put your project ID here>'
GCS_WORKING_DIR = 'gs://<Put your GCS path here>' # No ending slash
```

```python
# Optional parameters
EXPERIMENT_NAME = 'CLOUDML - Train'
TRAINER_GCS_PATH = GCS_WORKING_DIR + '/train/trainer.tar.gz'
OUTPUT_GCS_PATH = GCS_WORKING_DIR + '/train/output/'
```

#### Clean up the working directory

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
!gsutil rm -r $GCS_WORKING_DIR
```

#### Download the sample trainer code to a local directory

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
!wget https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/archive/master.zip
!unzip master.zip
```

#### Package code and upload the package to Cloud Storage

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%%bash -s "$TRAINER_GCS_PATH"
pushd ./cloudml-samples-master/census/estimator/
python setup.py sdist
gsutil cp dist/preprocessing-1.0.tar.gz $1
popd
rm -fr ./cloudml-samples-master/ ./master.zip ./dist
```

#### Example pipeline that uses the component

```python
import kfp.dsl as dsl
import json
@dsl.pipeline(
    name='CloudML training pipeline',
    description='CloudML training pipeline'
)
def pipeline(
    project_id = PROJECT_ID,
    python_module = 'trainer.task',
    package_uris = json.dumps([TRAINER_GCS_PATH]),
    region = 'us-central1',
    args = json.dumps([
        '--train-files', 'gs://cloud-samples-data/ml-engine/census/data/adult.data.csv',
        '--eval-files', 'gs://cloud-samples-data/ml-engine/census/data/adult.test.csv',
        '--train-steps', '1000',
        '--eval-steps', '100',
        '--verbosity', 'DEBUG'
    ]),
    job_dir = OUTPUT_GCS_PATH,
    python_version = '',
    runtime_version = '1.10',
    master_image_uri = '',
    worker_image_uri = '',
    training_input = '',
    job_id_prefix = '',
    wait_interval = '30'):
    task = mlengine_train_op(
        project_id=project_id, 
        python_module=python_module, 
        package_uris=package_uris, 
        region=region, 
        args=args, 
        job_dir=job_dir, 
        python_version=python_version,
        runtime_version=runtime_version, 
        master_image_uri=master_image_uri, 
        worker_image_uri=worker_image_uri, 
        training_input=training_input, 
        job_id_prefix=job_id_prefix, 
        wait_interval=wait_interval)
```

#### Compile the pipeline

```python
pipeline_func = pipeline
pipeline_filename = pipeline_func.__name__ + '.zip'
import kfp.compiler as compiler
compiler.Compiler().compile(pipeline_func, pipeline_filename)
```

#### Submit the pipeline for execution

```python
#Specify values for the pipeline's arguments
arguments = {}

#Get or create an experiment 
import kfp
client = kfp.Client()
experiment = client.create_experiment(EXPERIMENT_NAME)

#Submit a pipeline run
run_name = pipeline_func.__name__ + ' run'
run_result = client.run_pipeline(experiment.id, run_name, pipeline_filename, arguments)
```

#### Inspect the results

Use the following command to inspect the contents in the output directory:

```python
!gsutil ls $OUTPUT_GCS_PATH
```
