    "python_version | The version of Python used in the prediction. If it is not set, the default version is `2.7`. Python `3.5` is available when the runtime_version is set to `1.4` and above. Python `2.7` works with all supported runtime versions. | String | Yes | ` `\n",
    "version | The JSON payload of the new [Version](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.models.versions). | Dict | Yes | ` `\n",
