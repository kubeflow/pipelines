# Details
## Intended use
Use the component to run an Apache Hive job as one preprocessing step in a Kubeflow pipeline.

## Runtime arguments
| Argument | Description | Optional | Data type | Accepted values | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| project_id | The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project ID that the cluster belongs to. | No | GCPProjectId |   |   |
| region | The Cloud Dataproc region to handle the request. | No | GCPRegion |  |  |
| cluster_name | The name of the cluster to run the job. | No | String |  |  |
| queries | The queries to execute the Hive job. Specify multiple queries in one string by separating them with semicolons. You do not need to terminate queries with semicolons. | Yes | List |  | None |
| query_file_uri | The Hadoop Compatible Filesystem (HCFS) URI of the script that contains the Hive queries. | Yes | GCSPath |  | None |
| script_variables | Mapping of the query’s variable names to their values (equivalent to the Hive command: SET name="value";). | Yes | Dict |  | None |
| hive_job | The payload of a [Hive job](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rest/v1/HiveJob) | Yes | Dict |  | None |
| job | The payload of a [Dataproc job](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.regions.jobs). | Yes | Dict |  | None |
| wait_interval | The number of seconds to pause between polling the operation. | Yes | Integer |  | 30 |

## Output
Name | Description | Type
:--- | :---------- | :---
job_id | The ID of the created job. | String

## Cautions & requirements
To use the component, you must:
*   Set up a GCP project by following this [guide](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/setup-project).
*   [Create a new cluster](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/create-cluster).
*   The component can authenticate to GCP. Refer to [Authenticating Pipelines to GCP](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/authentication-pipelines/) for details.
*   Grant the Kubeflow user service account the role `roles/dataproc.editor` on the project.

## Detailed description
This component creates a Hive job from the [Dataproc submit job REST API](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.regions.jobs/submit).

Follow these steps to use the component in a pipeline:
1.  Install the Kubeflow pipeline's SDK:

    ```python
    %%capture --no-stderr

    KFP_PACKAGE = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/ml-pipeline/release/0.1.14/kfp.tar.gz'
    !pip3 install $KFP_PACKAGE --upgrade
    ```

2. Load the component using the Kubeflow pipeline's SDK:

    ```python
    import kfp.components as comp

    dataproc_submit_hive_job_op = comp.load_component_from_url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/pipelines/01a23ae8672d3b18e88adf3036071496aca3552d/components/gcp/dataproc/submit_hive_job/component.yaml')
    help(dataproc_submit_hive_job_op)
    ```

### Sample

The following sample code works in an IPython notebook or directly in Python code. See the sample code below to learn how to execute the template.


#### Setup a Dataproc cluster

[Create a new Dataproc cluster](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/create-cluster) (or reuse an existing one) before running the sample code.

#### Prepare a Hive query

You can put your Hive queries in the `queries` list, or you can use `query_file_uri`. In this sample, we will use a hard coded query in the `queries` list to select data from a public CSV file in Cloud Storage.

For more details, see the [Hive language manual.](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual)

#### Set sample parameters

```python
PROJECT_ID = '<Put your project ID here>'
CLUSTER_NAME = '<Put your existing cluster name here>'
REGION = 'us-central1'
QUERY = '''
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS natality_csv;
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE natality_csv (
  source_year BIGINT, year BIGINT, month BIGINT, day BIGINT, wday BIGINT,
  state STRING, is_male BOOLEAN, child_race BIGINT, weight_pounds FLOAT,
  plurality BIGINT, apgar_1min BIGINT, apgar_5min BIGINT,
  mother_residence_state STRING, mother_race BIGINT, mother_age BIGINT,
  gestation_weeks BIGINT, lmp STRING, mother_married BOOLEAN,
  mother_birth_state STRING, cigarette_use BOOLEAN, cigarettes_per_day BIGINT,
  alcohol_use BOOLEAN, drinks_per_week BIGINT, weight_gain_pounds BIGINT,
  born_alive_alive BIGINT, born_alive_dead BIGINT, born_dead BIGINT,
  ever_born BIGINT, father_race BIGINT, father_age BIGINT,
  record_weight BIGINT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LOCATION 'gs://public-datasets/natality/csv';

SELECT * FROM natality_csv LIMIT 10;'''
EXPERIMENT_NAME = 'Dataproc - Submit Hive Job'
```

#### Example pipeline that uses the component


```python
import kfp.dsl as dsl
import json
@dsl.pipeline(
    name='Dataproc submit Hive job pipeline',
    description='Dataproc submit Hive job pipeline'
)
def dataproc_submit_hive_job_pipeline(
    project_id = PROJECT_ID, 
    region = REGION,
    cluster_name = CLUSTER_NAME,
    queries = json.dumps([QUERY]),
    query_file_uri = '',
    script_variables = '', 
    hive_job='', 
    job='', 
    wait_interval='30'
):
    dataproc_submit_hive_job_op(
        project_id=project_id, 
        region=region, 
        cluster_name=cluster_name, 
        queries=queries, 
        query_file_uri=query_file_uri,
        script_variables=script_variables, 
        hive_job=hive_job, 
        job=job, 
        wait_interval=wait_interval)
    
```

#### Compile the pipeline


```python
pipeline_func = dataproc_submit_hive_job_pipeline
pipeline_filename = pipeline_func.__name__ + '.zip'
import kfp.compiler as compiler
compiler.Compiler().compile(pipeline_func, pipeline_filename)
```

#### Submit the pipeline for execution


```python
#Specify values for the pipeline's arguments
arguments = {}

#Get or create an experiment 
import kfp
client = kfp.Client()
experiment = client.create_experiment(EXPERIMENT_NAME)

#Submit a pipeline run
run_name = pipeline_func.__name__ + ' run'
run_result = client.run_pipeline(experiment.id, run_name, pipeline_filename, arguments)
```
