# Summary

A Kubeflow pipeline component to prepare data by submitting a Spark job on YARN to Cloud Dataproc.

# Details

## Intended use

Use the component to run an Apache Spark job as one preprocessing step in a Kubeflow pipeline.

## Runtime arguments
Argument | Description  | Optional | Data type | Accepted values | Default |
:--- | :---------- | :--- | :------- | :------| :------| 
project_id | The ID of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project that the cluster belongs to.|No | GCPProjectID |  |  |
region | The Cloud Dataproc region to handle the request. | No  | GCPRegion |  |  |  
cluster_name | The name of the cluster to run the job. | No | String |  |  |
main_jar_file_uri | The Hadoop Compatible Filesystem (HCFS) URI of the JAR file that contains the main class. | No | GCSPath |  | |
main_class | The name of the driver's main class. The JAR file that contains the class must be either in the default CLASSPATH or specified in  `spark_job.jarFileUris`.| No |  |  |  | 
args | The arguments to pass to the driver. Do not include arguments, such as --conf, that can be set as job properties, since a collision may occur that causes an incorrect job submission.| Yes |  |  | |
spark_job | The payload of a [SparkJob](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rest/v1/SparkJob).| Yes |  |  |  |
job | The payload of a [Dataproc job](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.regions.jobs). | Yes |  |  |  |
wait_interval | The number of seconds to wait between polling the operation.  |  Yes  | |  | 30 |

## Output
Name | Description | Type
:--- | :---------- | :---
job_id | The ID of the created job. | String

## Cautions & requirements

To use the component, you must:

*   Set up a GCP project by following this [guide](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/setup-project).
*   [Create a new cluster](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/create-cluster).
*   The component can authenticate to GCP. Refer to [Authenticating Pipelines to GCP](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/authentication-pipelines/) for details.
*   Grant the Kubeflow user service account the role `roles/dataproc.editor` on the project.


## Detailed description

This component creates a Spark job from the [Dataproc submit job REST API](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.regions.jobs/submit).

Follow these steps to use the component in a pipeline:



1.  Install the Kubeflow Pipeline's SDK:


    ```python
    %%capture --no-stderr

    !pip3 install kfp --upgrade
    ```

2. Load the component using the Kubeflow Pipeline's SDK


    ```python
    import kfp.components as comp

    dataproc_submit_spark_job_op = comp.load_component_from_url(
        'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/pipelines/1.4.1/components/gcp/dataproc/submit_spark_job/component.yaml')
    help(dataproc_submit_spark_job_op)
    ```

### Sample
Note: The following sample code works in an IPython notebook or directly in Python code.


#### Set up a Dataproc cluster
[Create a new Dataproc cluster](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/create-cluster) (or reuse an existing one) before running the sample code.


#### Prepare a Spark job
Upload your Spark JAR file to a Cloud Storage bucket. In the sample, we use a JAR file that is preinstalled in the main cluster: `file:///usr/lib/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples.jar`.

Here is the [source code of the sample](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/examples/JavaSparkPi.java).

To package a self-contained Spark application, follow these [instructions](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html#self-contained-applications).


#### Set sample parameters


```python
PROJECT_ID = '<Put your project ID here>'
CLUSTER_NAME = '<Put your existing cluster name here>'
REGION = 'us-central1'
SPARK_FILE_URI = 'file:///usr/lib/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples.jar'
MAIN_CLASS = 'org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi'
ARGS = ['1000']
EXPERIMENT_NAME = 'Dataproc - Submit Spark Job'
```

#### Example pipeline that uses the component


```python
import kfp.dsl as dsl
import json
@dsl.pipeline(
    name='Dataproc submit Spark job pipeline',
    description='Dataproc submit Spark job pipeline'
)
def dataproc_submit_spark_job_pipeline(
    project_id = PROJECT_ID, 
    region = REGION,
    cluster_name = CLUSTER_NAME,
    main_jar_file_uri = '',
    main_class = MAIN_CLASS,
    args = json.dumps(ARGS), 
    spark_job=json.dumps({ 'jarFileUris': [ SPARK_FILE_URI ] }), 
    job='{}', 
    wait_interval='30'
):
    dataproc_submit_spark_job_op(
        project_id=project_id, 
        region=region, 
        cluster_name=cluster_name, 
        main_jar_file_uri=main_jar_file_uri, 
        main_class=main_class,
        args=args, 
        spark_job=spark_job, 
        job=job, 
        wait_interval=wait_interval)
    
```

#### Compile the pipeline


```python
#Compile the pipeline
pipeline_func = dataproc_submit_spark_job_pipeline
pipeline_filename = pipeline_func.__name__ + '.zip'
import kfp.compiler as compiler
compiler.Compiler().compile(pipeline_func, pipeline_filename)
```

#### Submit the pipeline for execution


```python
#Specify values for the pipeline's arguments
arguments = {}

#Get or create an experiment
import kfp
client = kfp.Client()
experiment = client.create_experiment(EXPERIMENT_NAME)

#Submit a pipeline run
run_name = pipeline_func.__name__ + ' run'
run_result = client.run_pipeline(experiment.id, run_name, pipeline_filename, arguments)
```
