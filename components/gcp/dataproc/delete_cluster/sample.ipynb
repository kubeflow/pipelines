    "Use this component at the start of a Kubeflow Pipeline to delete a temporary Cloud Dataproc \n",
    "cluster to run Cloud Dataproc jobs as steps in the pipeline. This component is usually \n",
    "used with an [exit handler](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/samples/core/exit_handler/exit_handler.py) to run at the end of a pipeline.\n",

    "To use the component, you must:\n",
    "*   Set up a GCP project by following this [guide](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/setup-project).\n",
    "*   The component can authenticate to GCP. Refer to [Authenticating Pipelines to GCP](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/authentication-pipelines/) for details.\n",
