    "Use this component at the start of a Kubeflow Pipeline to delete a temporary Cloud Dataproc \n",
    "cluster to run Cloud Dataproc jobs as steps in the pipeline. This component is usually \n",
    "used with an [exit handler](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/samples/core/exit_handler/exit_handler.py) to run at the end of a pipeline.\n",
