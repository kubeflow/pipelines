    "# Executing an Apache Beam Python job in Cloud Dataflow\n",
    "A Kubeflow Pipeline component that submits an Apache Beam job (authored in Python) to Cloud Dataflow for execution. The Python Beam code is run with the Cloud Dataflow Runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intended Use\n",
    "Use this component to run a Python Beam code to submit a Dataflow job as a step of a KFP pipeline. The component will wait until the job finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Runtime arguments\n",
    "Name | Description | Type | Optional | Default\n",
    ":--- | :---------- | :--- | :------- | :------\n",
    "python_file_path |  The Cloud Storage or the local path to the python file being run. | String | No |\n",
    "project_id |  The ID of the parent project of the Dataflow job. | GCPProjectID | No |\n",
    "staging_dir | The Cloud Storage directory for keeping staging files. A random subdirectory will be created under the directory to keep job info for resuming the job in case of failure and it will be passed as `staging_location` and `temp_location` command line args of the beam code. | GCSPath | Yes | ` `\n",
    "requirements_file_path |  The Cloud Storageor the local path to the pip requirements file. | String | Yes | ` `\n",
    "args |  The list of arguments to pass to the python file. | List | Yes | `[]`\n",
    "wait_interval |  The seconds to wait between calls to get the job status. | Integer | Yes | `30`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output:\n",
    "Name | Description | Type\n",
    ":--- | :---------- | :---\n",
    "job_id | The id of the created dataflow job. | String\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cautions and requirements\n",
    "To use the components, the following requirements must be met:\n",
    "* Dataflow API is enabled.\n",
    "* The component is running under a secret [Kubeflow user service account](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started-gke/#gcp-service-accounts) in a KFP cluster. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "component_op(...).apply(gcp.use_gcp_secret('user-gcp-sa'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "* The Kubeflow user service account is a member of `roles/dataflow.developer` role of the project.\n",
    "* The Kubeflow user service account is a member of `roles/storage.objectViewer` role of the Cloud Storage Objects `python_file_path` and `requirements_file_path`.\n",
    "* The Kubeflow user service account is a member of `roles/storage.objectCreator` role of the Cloud Storage Object `staging_dir`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed description\n",
    "Before using the component, make sure the following files are prepared in a Cloud Storage bucket.\n",
    "* A Beam Python code file.\n",
    "* A `requirements.txt` file which includes a list of dependent packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Beam Python code should follow [Beam programing model](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/) and the following additional requirements to be compatible with this component:\n",
    "* It accepts command line arguments: `--project`, `--temp_location`, `--staging_location`, which are [standard Dataflow Runner options](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#setting-other-cloud-pipeline-options).\n",
    "* Enable info logging before the start of a Dataflow job in the Python code. This is important to allow the component to track the status and ID of create job. For example: calling `logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.INFO)` before any other code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The component does several things during the execution:\n",
    "* Download `python_file_path` and `requirements_file_path` to local files.\n",
    "* Start a subprocess to launch the Python program.\n",
    "* Monitor the logs produced from the subprocess to extract Dataflow job information.\n",
    "* Store Dataflow job information in `staging_dir` so the job can be resumed in case of failure.\n",
    "* Wait for the job to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps to use the component in a pipeline:\n",
