# Private Security Vulnerability Reporting

When reporting a vulnerability, please include a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue. If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a Security Advisory. This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.

To report a security issue, follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
