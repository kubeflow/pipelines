# Private Security Vulnerability Reporting

When reporting a vulnerability, please include a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue. If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a Security Advisory. This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.

To report a security issue, please choose one of the options below:

- Use [https://g.co/vulnz](https://g.co/vulnz). We use `g.co/vulnz` for our intake, and do coordination and disclosure here on GitHub (including using GitHub Security Advisory). The Google Security Team will respond within 5 working days of your report on `g.co/vulnz`.

- Report a security vulnerability private via GitHub built-in function by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
