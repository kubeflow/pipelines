## V2 mock pipelines specification

This folder is for KFP UI to mock backend response, the files here are copied from 
[sdk/python/kfp/v2/compiler_cli_tests/test_data](sdk/python/kfp/v2/compiler_cli_tests/test_data). This folder doesn't need to be in sync with the code source in sdk/python/kfp/v2/compiler_cli_tests/test_data folder, but you can do it manually if there is a need to facilitate frontend development by using newer version of compiled pipeline definition.
