# ML Pipeline Management Frontend

**Develop:** You need `npm`, install dependencies using `npm install`.

You can then do `npm run dev` to run a static file server at port 3000 that watches the source files, rebuilds into `./dist` and serves the latest changes from there. This also starts a mock REST API backend server using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), which you can interact with by going to http://localhost:3000/resource_name, for example: http://localhost:3000/_templates will return the list of templates currently defined in the mock database.
