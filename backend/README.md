# Kubeflow Pipelines Backend

## Overview

This directory contains code for the components that comprise the Kubeflow
Pipelines backend.

This README will help you set up your coding environment in order to build and run the Kubeflow Pipelines backend. The KFP backend powers the core functionality of the KFP platform, handling API requests, workflow management, and data persistence.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:
- [Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Docker or Podman installed (for building container images)

Note that you may need to restart your shell after installing these resources in order for the changes to take effect.

## Building & Testing

To run all unittests for backend:

```
go test -v -cover ./backend/...
```

The API server itself can be built using:

```
go build -o /tmp/apiserver backend/src/apiserver/*.go
```

The API server image can be built from the root folder of the repo using:
```
export API_SERVER_IMAGE=api_server
docker build -f backend/Dockerfile . --tag $API_SERVER_IMAGE
```
### Deploying the APIServer (from the image you built) on Kubernetes

First, push your image to a registry that is accessible from your Kubernetes cluster. 

Then, run:
```
kubectl edit deployment.v1.apps/ml-pipeline -n kubeflow
```
You'll see the field reference the api server container image (`spec.containers[0].image: gcr.io/ml-pipeline/api-server:<image-version>`).
Change it to point to your own build, after saving and closing the file, apiserver will restart with your change.

### Building client library and swagger files

After making changes to proto files, the Go client libraries, Python client libraries and swagger files
need to be regenerated and checked-in. Refer to [backend/api](./api/README.md) for details.

### Updating python dependencies

[pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) is used to manage python
dependencies. To update dependencies, edit [requirements.in](requirements.in)
and run `./update_requirements.sh` to update and pin the transitive
dependencies.


### Building conformance tests (WIP)

Run
```
docker build . -f backend/Dockerfile.conformance -t <tag>
```

## API Server Development

### Run the KFP Backend Locally With a Kind Cluster

This deploys a local Kubernetes cluster leveraging [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), with all the components required
to run the Kubeflow Pipelines API server. Note that the `ml-pipeline` `Deployment` (API server) has its replicas set to
0 so that the API server can be run locally for debugging and faster development. The local API server is available by
pods on the cluster using the `ml-pipeline` `Service`.

#### Prerequisites

* The [kind CLI](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) is installed.
* The following ports are available on your localhost: 3000, 3306, 8080, 9000, and 8889. If these are unavailable,
  modify [kind-config.yaml](../tools/kind/kind-config.yaml) and configure the API server with alternative ports when
  running locally.
* If using a Mac, you will need to modify the
  [Endpoints](../manifests/kustomize/env/dev-kind/forward-local-api-endpoint.yaml) manifest to leverage the bridge
  network interface through Docker/Podman Desktop. See
  [kind #1200](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/1200#issuecomment-1304855791) for an example manifest.
* Optional: VSCode is installed to leverage a sample `launch.json` file.
  * This relies on dlv: (go install -v github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest)

#### Provisioning the Cluster

To provision the kind cluster, run the following from the Git repository's root directory,:

```bash
make -C backend dev-kind-cluster
```

This may take several minutes since there are many pods. Note that many pods will be in "CrashLoopBackOff" status until
all the pods have started.

> [!NOTE]
> The config in the `make` command above sets the `ml-pipeline` `Deployment` (api server) to have 0 replicas. The intent is to replace it with a locally running API server for debugging and faster development. See the following steps to run the API server locally, and connect it to the KFP backend on your Kind cluster. Note that other backend components (for example, the persistence agent) may show errors until the API server is brought up and connected to the cluster.

#### Launching the API Server With VSCode

After the cluster is provisioned, you may leverage the following sample `.vscode/launch.json` file to run the API
server locally:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Launch API Server (Kind)",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "launch",
      "mode": "debug",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/backend/src/apiserver",
      "env": {
        "POD_NAMESPACE": "kubeflow",
        "DBCONFIG_MYSQLCONFIG_HOST": "localhost",
        "MINIO_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST": "localhost",
        "MINIO_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT": "9000",
        "METADATA_GRPC_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST": "localhost",
        "METADATA_GRPC_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT": "8080",
        "ML_PIPELINE_VISUALIZATIONSERVER_SERVICE_HOST": "localhost",
        "ML_PIPELINE_VISUALIZATIONSERVER_SERVICE_PORT": "8888"
      },
      "args": [
        "--config",
        "${workspaceFolder}/backend/src/apiserver/config",
        "-logtostderr=true"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Using the Environment

Once the cluster is provisioned and the API server is running, you can access the API server at
[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
(e.g. [http://localhost:8888/apis/v2beta1/pipelines](http://localhost:8888/apis/v2beta1/pipelines)).

You can also access the Kubeflow Pipelines web interface at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can also directly connect to the MariaDB database server with:

```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root
```

### Scheduled Workflow Development

If you also want to run the Scheduled Workflow controller locally, stop the controller on the cluster with:

```bash
kubectl -n kubeflow scale deployment ml-pipeline-scheduledworkflow --replicas=0
```

Then you may leverage the following sample `.vscode/launch.json` file to run the Scheduled Workflow controller locally:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch Scheduled Workflow controller (Kind)",
            "type": "go",
            "request": "launch",
            "mode": "debug",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/backend/src/crd/controller/scheduledworkflow",
            "env": {
                "CRON_SCHEDULE_TIMEZONE": "UTC"
            },
            "args": [
                "-namespace=kubeflow",
                "-kubeconfig=${workspaceFolder}/kubeconfig_dev-pipelines-api",
                "-mlPipelineAPIServerName=localhost"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Remote Debug the Driver

These instructions assume you are leveraging the Kind cluster in the
[Run Locally With a Kind Cluster](#run-locally-with-a-kind-cluster) section.

#### Build the Driver Image With Debug Prerequisites

Run the following to create the `backend/Dockerfile.driver-debug` file and build the container image
tagged as `kfp-driver:debug`. This container image is based on `backend/Dockerfile.driver` but installs
[Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve), builds the binary without compiler optimizations so the binary matches the
source code (via `GCFLAGS="all=-N -l"`), and copies the source code to the destination container for the debugger.
Any changes to the Driver code will require rebuilding this container image.

```bash
make -C backend image_driver_debug
```

Then load the container image in the Kind cluster.

```bash
make -C backend kind-load-driver-debug
```

Alternatively, you can use this Make target that does both.

```bash
make -C kind-build-and-load-driver-debug
```

#### Run the API Server With Debug Configuration

You may use the following VS Code `launch.json` file to run the API server which overrides the Driver
command to use Delve and the Driver image to use debug image built previously.

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch API server (Kind) (Debug Driver)",
            "type": "go",
            "request": "launch",
            "mode": "debug",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/backend/src/apiserver",
            "env": {
                "POD_NAMESPACE": "kubeflow",
                "DBCONFIG_MYSQLCONFIG_HOST": "localhost",
                "MINIO_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST": "localhost",
                "MINIO_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT": "9000",
                "METADATA_GRPC_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST": "localhost",
                "METADATA_GRPC_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT": "8080",
                "ML_PIPELINE_VISUALIZATIONSERVER_SERVICE_HOST": "localhost",
                "ML_PIPELINE_VISUALIZATIONSERVER_SERVICE_PORT": "8888",
                "V2_DRIVER_IMAGE": "kfp-driver:debug",
                "V2_DRIVER_COMMAND": "dlv exec --listen=:2345 --headless=true --api-version=2 --log /bin/driver --",
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Starting a Remote Debug Session

Start by launching a pipeline. This will eventually create a Driver pod that is waiting for a remote debug connection.

You can see the pods with the following command.

```bash
kubectl -n kubeflow get pods -w
```

Once you see a pod with `-driver` in the name such as `hello-world-clph9-system-dag-driver-10974850`, port forward
the Delve port in the pod to your localhost (replace `<driver pod name>` with the actual name).

```bash
kubectl -n kubeflow port-forward <driver pod name> 2345:2345
```

Set a breakpoint on the Driver code in VS Code. Then remotely connect to the Delve debug session with the following VS
Code `launch.json` file:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Connect to remote driver",
            "type": "go",
            "request": "attach",
            "mode": "remote",
            "remotePath": "/go/src/github.com/kubeflow/pipelines",
            "port": 2345,
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
        }
    ]
}
```

Once the Driver pod succeeds, the remote debug session will close. Then repeat the process of forwarding the port
of subsequent Driver pods and starting remote debug sessions in VS Code until the pipeline completes.

For debugging a specific Driver pod, you'll need to continuously port forward and connect to the remote debug session
without a breakpoint so that Delve will continue execution until the Driver pod you are interested in starts up. At that
point, you can set a break point, port forward, and connect to the remote debug session to debug that specific Driver
pod.

### Deleting the Kind Cluster

Run the following to delete the cluster (once you are finished):

```bash
kind delete clusters dev-pipelines-api
```

### Code Style
          
Backend codebase follows the [Google's Go Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/). Please, take time to get familiar with the [best practices](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/best-practices). It is not intended to be exhaustive, but it often helps minimizing guesswork among developers and keep codebase uniform and consistent.

We use [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) tool that can catch common mistakes locally (see detailed configuration [here](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/.golangci.yaml)). It can be [conveniently integrated](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/integrations/) with multiple popular IDEs such as VS Code or Vim.

Finally, it is advised to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) in order to automate linter checks (see configuration [here](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml))
