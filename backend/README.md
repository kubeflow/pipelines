This directory contains code for the components that comprise the Kubeflow
Pipelines backend.

## Building & Testing

To run all unittests for backend: 

```
go test -v -cover ./backend/...
```

The API server itself can be built using:

```
go build -o /tmp/apiserver backend/src/apiserver/*.go
```

## Building APIServer image locally

The API server image can be built from the root folder of the repo using: 
```
export API_SERVER_IMAGE=api_server
docker build -f backend/Dockerfile . --tag $API_SERVER_IMAGE
```
## Deploy APIServer with the image you own build

Run
```
kubectl edit deployment.v1.apps/ml-pipeline -n kubeflow
```
You'll see the field reference the api server docker image.
Change it to point to your own build, after saving and closing the file, apiserver will restart with your change.

## Building client library and swagger files

After making changes to proto files, the Go client libraries, Python client libraries and swagger files
need to be regenerated and checked-in. Refer to [backend/api](./api/README.md) for details.
