# Visualization Template types:
# - Basic: Uses the basic.tpl file within the templates directory to generate
# a visualization that contains no styling and minimal HTML tags. This is ideal
# for testing as it reduces size of generated visualization. However, for usage
# with actual visualizations it is not ideal due to its lack of javascript and
# styling which can limit usability of a visualization.
# - Full: Uses the full.tpl file within the template directory to generate a
# visualization that can be viewed as a standalone web page. The full.tpl file
# utilizes the basic.tpl file for visualizations then wraps that output with
# additional tags for javascript and style support. This is ideal for generating
# visualizations that will be displayed via the frontend.
