# This example shows how to use a Kubernetes local persistent volume with Tensorboard
# viewer. The definition below assumes you have a volume called
# 'argo-volume' in the cluster. This persistent volume will be mounted to
# /workdir, and /workdir/tensorboard is specified as the logdir parameter for
# Tensorboard. This assumes you have Tensorboard data in the logdir path.
