# Typically we can't support multiple major versions of protobuf
# The runtime protobuf package MUST be aligned with the protobuf
# libraries used to generate the code (protoc, protoc-gen-go, etc.)
# For example protobuf 5.x aligns with protoc 26.x-29.x but
# 6.x aligns with 30.x+.
# See for support tiers:
# https://protobuf.dev/support/version-support/#python
protobuf==6.31.1,<7.0
