#Due to the way Prow testing scripts are called, any big change needs to be done in multiple steps/check-ins so that nothing breaks.
#Here is the sequence of check-ins:
#New entry-point script (this script - presubmit-tests.gke.sh)
#Change test entry-point in Prow config
#Remove unused code from the original script (presubmit-tests.sh).

#Need to parse the command line to get the workflow name to generate the cluster name.
