# This manifest file creates a cluster admin role and bind to default service account in default namespace,
# before starting the deployment job. This is needed since the deployment job runs a pod that creates
# more cluster roles in the cluster. The pod is ran by the default service account so this account needs
# additional permission to finish the deployment job successfully.
#
# If you think the default service account shouldn't need that level of RBAC permission in the future,
# it's safe to delete the mlpipeline-admin-role-binding after deployment succeeded:
# kubectl delete ClusterRoleBinding mlpipeline-admin-role-binding
# Or you can run the deployment job with service account you would like to use.
