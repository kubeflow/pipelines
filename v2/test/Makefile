# matter your working dir is dirty or not. It always packages current content

# Note, there's one caveat, for any files not tracked by git, they will not be uploaded.
# So recommend doing a `git add -A` before running this if you added new files. However,
# it's OK to have dirty files, the dirty version in your workdir will be uploaded
# as expected.
