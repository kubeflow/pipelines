# ML Pipeline Services - Overview

This project is aimed at:

* End to end orchestration: enabling and simplifying the orchestration of end to end machine learning pipelines
* Easy Experimentation: making it easy for users to try numerous ideas and techniques, and manage the various trials/experiments.
* Easy Re-Use: enabling users to re-use components and pipelines to quickly cobble together end to end solutions, without having to re-build each time.

## Introduction

### The Python Code to Represent a Pipeline Workflow Graph

```python

@mlp.pipeline(
  name='XGBoost Trainer',
  description='A trainer that does end-to-end distributed training for XGBoost models.'
)
def xgb_train_pipeline(
    output,
    project,
    region=PipelineParam(value='us-central1')
    train_data=PipelineParam(value='gs://ml-pipeline-playground/sfpd/train.csv'),
    eval_data=PipelineParam(value='gs://ml-pipeline-playground/sfpd/eval.csv'),
    schema=PipelineParam(value='gs://ml-pipeline-playground/sfpd/schema.json'),
    target=PipelineParam(value='resolution'),
    rounds=PipelineParam(value=200),
    workers=PipelineParam(value=2),
):
  delete_cluster_op = DeleteClusterOp('delete-cluster', project, region)
  with mlp.ExitHandler(exit_op=delete_cluster_op):
    create_cluster_op = CreateClusterOp('create-cluster', project, region, output)

    analyze_op = AnalyzeOp('analyze', project, region, create_cluster_op.output, schema,
                           train_data, '%s/{{workflow.name}}/analysis' % output)

    transform_op = TransformOp('transform', project, region, create_cluster_op.output,
                               train_data, eval_data, target, analyze_op.output,
                               '%s/{{workflow.name}}/transform' % output)

    train_op = TrainerOp('train', project, region, create_cluster_op.output, transform_op.outputs['train'],
                         transform_op.outputs['eval'], target, analyze_op.output, workers,
                         rounds, '%s/{{workflow.name}}/model' % output)

    predict_op = PredictOp('predict', project, region, create_cluster_op.output, transform_op.outputs['eval'],
                           train_op.output, target, analyze_op.output, '%s/{{workflow.name}}/predict' % output)

    confusion_matrix_op = ConfusionMatrixOp('confusion-matrix', predict_op.output,
                                            '%s/{{workflow.name}}/confusionmatrix' % output)

    roc_op = RocOp('roc', predict_op.output, '%s/{{workflow.name}}/roc' % output)

# ML Pipeline Services - User Guideline

This document guides you through the steps to deploy Machine Learning Pipeline Services and run your first pipeline sample. 

## Requirements

The guideline assume you have a [GCP Project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) ready. You can use [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/quickstart) to run all the commands in this guideline. 

Alternatively, if you prefer to install and interact with GKE from your local machine, make sure you have [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#download-as-part-of-the-google-cloud-sdk) installed locally.
 
## Setup a GKE cluster

Follow the [instruction](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) and create a GCP project. 
Once created, enable the GKE API in this [page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/enabled). You can also find more details about enabling the [billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project?#enable-billing), as well as activating [GKE API](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart#before-you-begin).

We recommend to use CloudShell from the GCP console to run the below commands. CloudShell starts with an environment already logged in to your account and set to the currently selected project. The following two commands are requried only in a workstation shell environment, they are not needed in the CloudShell. 

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project [your-project-id]
```

The ML Pipeline Services will be running on a GKE cluster. To start a new GKE cluster, first set a default compute zone (us-central1-a in this case):
```bash
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a
```
Then start a GKE cluster. 
```bash
gcloud container clusters create [YOUR-CLUSTER-NAME] \
  --zone us-central1-a \
  --scopes cloud-platform \
  --enable-cloud-logging \
  --enable-cloud-monitoring \
  --machine-type n1-standard-2 \
  --num-nodes 4
```
Here we choose cloud-platform scope so it can invoke GCP APIs. You can find all options for creating a cluster in [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create). 

ML Pipelines Services uses Argo as its underlying orchestration system. When installing ML Pipeline Services, a few new cluster roles will be generated for Argo and Pipelineâ€™s API server, in order to allow them creating and retrieving resources such as pods, Argo workflow CRDs etc. 

On GKE with RBAC enabled, you might need to grant your account the ability to create such new cluster roles.

```bash
kubectl create clusterrolebinding BINDING_NAME --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUREMAIL@YOURDOMAIN.com
```
 
## Deploy ML Pipeline Services and Kubeflow 

Go to [release page](https://github.com/googleprivate/ml/releases) to find a version of ML Pipeline Services. Deploy the ML Pipeline Services and Kubeflow to your cluster.

For example:
```bash
kubectl create -f https://storage.googleapis.com/ml-pipeline/release/$VERSION/bootstrapper.yaml
```
And by running `kubectl get job`, you should see a job created that deploys ML pipeline along with all dependencies in the cluster.
```
NAME                      DESIRED   SUCCESSFUL   AGE
deploy-ml-pipeline-wjqwt  1         1            9m
```
You can check the deployment log in case of any failure
```bash
kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods -l job-name=[JOB_NAME] -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
```

By default, the ML pipeline will deployed with usage collection turned on. 
We use [Spartakus](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/spartakus) which does not report any personal identifiable information (PII).

If you want to turn off the usage report, or deploy to a different namespace, you can pass in additional arguments to the deployment job.
See [bootstrapper.yaml](https://github.com/googleprivate/ml/blob/master/bootstrapper.yaml#L57) file for example arguments.


When deployment is successful, forward its port to visit the ML pipeline UI. 
```bash
kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods -l app=ml-pipeline-ui -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8080:3000
```
If you are using Cloud Shell, you could view the UI by open the [web preview](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-web-preview#previewing_the_application) button ![alt text](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/images/web-preview-button.png). Make sure the it's preview on port 8080.

If you are using local console instead of Cloud Shell, you can access the ML pipeline UI at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Run your first TFJob pipeline
See the following authoring guide on how to compile your python pipeline code into workflow yaml. Then, follow [README.md](https://github.com/googleprivate/ml/blob/master/samples/kubeflow-tf/README.md) to deploy your first TFJob pipeline.  

## Uninstall
To uninstall ML pipeline, create a job following the same steps as installation, with additional uninstall argument. 
Check [bootstrapper.yaml](https://storage.googleapis.com/ml-pipeline/bootstrapper.yaml) for details.


# ML Pipeline Services - Authoring Guideline

For more details, see [README.md](https://github.com/googleprivate/ml/blob/master/samples/README.md).

## Setup
* Create a python3 envionronment.
 
* Install a version of DSL and DSL Compiler.
 
Go to [release page](https://github.com/googleprivate/ml/releases) to find a version of the source code zip. Download and decompress it. Run the following:

```bash
cd $EXTRACTED_DIRECTORY
pip install ./dsl/ --upgrade # The library to specify pipelines with Python.
pip install ./dsl-compiler/ --upgrade # The compiler that converts pipeline code into the form required by the pipeline system.
 ```
 
Note: if you prefer adding "--user" in installation of dsl-compiler, please also run "export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH".
Note: if you are feeling adventurous and want the latest, just git clone the repo and install dsl and dsl-compiler from there.

After successful installation the command "dsl-compile" should be added to your PATH.

## Compile the samples
The sample pipelines are represented as Python code. To run these samples, you need to compile them, and then upload the output to the Pipeline system from web UI. 
<!--- 
In the future, we will build the compiler into the pipeline system such that these python files are immediately deployable.
--->

```bash
dsl-compile --py [path/to/py/file] --output [path/to/output/yaml]
```

For example:

```bash
cd $EXTRACTED_DIRECTORY
dsl-compile --py ./samples/basic/sequential.py --output ./samples/basic/sequential.yaml
```

## Deploy the samples
Upload the generated yaml file through the ML pipeline UI.
