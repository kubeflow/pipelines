### Frontend
**Build:** You need `npm`. You can then do `npm run build` to build the frontend.

**Serve**: You can do `npm run dev` to run a static file server for everything under `dist/`, as well as a mock backend REST API server using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), then go to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the app.
