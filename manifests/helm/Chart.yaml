  # Prerequisites:
  # - cert-manager must be pre-installed (cluster-wide infrastructure)
  # - Argo Workflows cluster resources must be pre-installed
  # - MySQL database for ML Metadata (MLMD) - pipelines/versions stored as K8s CRs
  # Note: Kubernetes-native mode stores pipelines as CRs, NOT in MySQL.
