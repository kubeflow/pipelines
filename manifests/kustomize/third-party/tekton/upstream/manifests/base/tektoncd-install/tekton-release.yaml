  #
  # Note: This feature flag is deprecated and will be removed in release v0.60. Consider using `coschedule` feature flag to configure Affinity Assistant behavior.
  disable-affinity-assistant: "false"
  # Setting this flag will determine how PipelineRun Pods are scheduled with Affinity Assistant.
  # Acceptable values are "workspaces" (default), "pipelineruns", "isolate-pipelinerun", or "disabled".
  #
  # Setting it to "workspaces" will schedule all the taskruns sharing the same PVC-based workspace in a pipelinerun to the same node.
  # Setting it to "pipelineruns" will schedule all the taskruns in a pipelinerun to the same node.
  # Setting it to "isolate-pipelinerun" will schedule all the taskruns in a pipelinerun to the same node,
  # and only allows one pipelinerun to run on a node at a time.
  # Setting it to "disabled" will not apply any coschedule policy.
  #
  # See more in the Affinity Assistant documentation
  # https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/affinityassistants.md
  coschedule: "workspaces"
  # Setting this flag to "true" will prevent Tekton scanning attached

  # Steps.
  #
  # The default behaviour currently is for Tekton to search service
  # accounts for secrets matching a specified format and automatically
  # mount those into your Steps.

  # Note: setting this to "true" will prevent PipelineResources from
  # working.
  #
  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/2791 for more

  disable-creds-init: "false"
  # Setting this flag to "false" will stop Tekton from waiting for a
  # TaskRun's sidecar containers to be running before starting the first
  # step. This will allow Tasks to be run in environments that don't
  # support the DownwardAPI volume type, but may lead to unintended
  # behaviour if sidecars are used.

  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/4937 for more info.

  # This option should be set to false when Pipelines is running in a
  # cluster that does not use injected sidecars such as Istio. Setting
  # it to false should decrease the time it takes for a TaskRun to start
  # running. For clusters that use injected sidecars, setting this

  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/2080 for more info.

  send-cloudevents-for-runs: "false"
  # This flag affects the behavior of taskruns and pipelineruns in cases where no VerificationPolicies match them.
  # If it is set to "fail", TaskRuns and PipelineRuns will fail verification if no matching policies are found.
  # If it is set to "warn", TaskRuns and PipelineRuns will run to completion if no matching policies are found, and an error will be logged.

  trusted-resources-verification-no-match-policy: "ignore"
  # Setting this flag to "true" enables populating the "provenance" field in TaskRun

  # in the TaskRun/PipelineRun such as the source from where a remote Task/Pipeline
  # definition was fetched.
  enable-provenance-in-status: "true"
  # Setting this flag will determine how Tekton pipelines will handle non-falsifiable provenance.
  # If set to "spire", then SPIRE will be used to ensure non-falsifiable provenance.
  # If set to "none", then Tekton will not have non-falsifiable provenance.
  # This is an experimental feature and thus should still be considered an alpha feature.
  enforce-nonfalsifiability: "none"
  # Setting this flag will determine how Tekton pipelines will handle extracting results from the task.

  # When results-from is set to "sidecar-logs", this flag can be used to configure the upper limit of a task result
  # max-result-size: "4096"
  # Setting this flag to "true" will limit privileges for containers injected by Tekton into TaskRuns.
