# Separate service for new ports of seaweedfs. If we add them to the existing minio-service there will be a problem
# with the mlpipeline api server because it relies on MINIO_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT pointing to the S3 port.
# But with multiple ports on a service that is not really reliable. So we use the existing minio-service for
# backwards-compatibility, but everything new, seaweedfs related is here.
