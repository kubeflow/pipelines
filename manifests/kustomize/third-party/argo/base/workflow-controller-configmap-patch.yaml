      # keyFormat is a format pattern to define how artifacts will be organized in a bucket.
      # It can reference workflow metadata variables such as workflow.namespace, workflow.name,
      # pod.name. Can also use strftime formating of workflow.creationTimestamp so that workflow
      # artifacts can be organized by date. If omitted, will use `{{workflow.name}}/{{pod.name}}`,
      # which has potential for have collisions, because names do not guarantee they are unique
      # over the lifetime of the cluster.
      # Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/.

      # The following format looks like:
