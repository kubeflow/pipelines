## Artifact download responses

Artifact download routes return S3 and MinIO objects without extracting archive
contents and force the browser to treat every response as an attachment. Archive
filenames are preserved when available. Preview routes may still decompress an
archive and show its first entry, but they use the same download-only response
hardening; clients should consume the response body instead of relying on browser
inline rendering.
