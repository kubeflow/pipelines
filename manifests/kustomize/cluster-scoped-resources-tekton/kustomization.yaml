# packages. Therefore, we added prefix `kfp-cluster-scoped-` to distinguish it from
# others.
    # cache deployer sa's metadata.namespace will be first transformed by namespace field in kustomization.yaml
    # so that we only need to change kustomization.yaml's namespace field for namespace customization.
