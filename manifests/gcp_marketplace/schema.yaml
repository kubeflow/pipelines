    type: boolean
    title: Use managed storage
    description: |-
      Use Cloud SQL and GCS for storing the data.
      Using CloudSQL and GCS provides better reliability and performance,
      as well as features such as data backup and usage monitoring.
      This is the recommended option especially for production scenarios.

      If yes, you must specify GCS bucket and CloudSQL instance below. Note, to
      reserve your data while reinstalling Kubeflow Pipelines, you must use
      exactly the same managed storage options as before.

      If upgrading from managed storage Kubeflow Pipelines 0.5.1, GCS bucket
      name was previously auto generated in the same project, it should have been
      named like "<cloudsql instance connection name>-<database prefix or instance name>".

      If false, following options will be ignored and the data will be stored in
      GCE Persistent Disks.
    default: false
  managedstorage.gcsBucketName:
    type: string
    title: Artifact storage GCS bucket (Managed storage only)
    description: |-
      This field must be specified if choose to use managed storage.
      Provide the Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket name for an existing bucket.
      The bucket will be used for storing the output artifacts.
      For more details on how to create a new bucket, see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets.

      Warning, if provided bucket doesn't exist, deployer will automatically
      create a bucket for you in us-central1, but you won't be able to customize
      any parameters.
  managedstorage.cloudsqlInstanceConnectionName:
    type: string
    title: Cloud SQL instance connection name (Managed storage only)
    description: |-
      This field must be specified if choose to use managed storage.
      Provide the instance connection name for an existing Cloud SQL for MySQL instance.
      The instance connection name can be found on the instance detail page in the Cloud SQL console.
      The instance connection name uses the format project:zone:instance-name, for example,myproject:us-central1:myinstance.
      For more details on how to create a new instance, see https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/quickstart.
  managedstorage.dbUsername:
    type: string
    title: Database username (Managed storage only)
    description: |-
      The database username to use when connecting to the Cloud SQL instance.
      If you leave this field empty, the deployment will use the default 'root' user account to connect.
      For more details about MySQL users, see https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/users.
  managedstorage.dbPassword:
    type: string
    title: Database password (Managed storage only)
    x-google-marketplace:
      type: MASKED_FIELD
    description: |-
      The database password to use when connecting to the Cloud SQL instance.
      If you leave this field empty, the deployment will try to connect to the instance without providing a password.
      This will fail if a password is required for the username you provided.
  managedstorage.databaseNamePrefix:
    type: string
    title: Database name prefix (Managed storage only)
    description: |-
      The prefix of the database name. Kubeflow Pipelines will create two databases,
      [prefix]_pipeline and [prefix]_metadata.
      Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Start with a letter.
      If the prefix specified is same as an old deployment in the past,
      the deployment will recover from an old deployment.
      If this not specified, the app instance name will be used.
