  serviceAccountCredential:
    title: |-
     GCP Service Account credentials used to call other GCP services.
    description: |-
      To be able to call other GCP services from the pipeline, we need to be authenticated.
      The associated service account should have Cloud SQL and GCS access permissions/roles at
      minimum, as well as any permission you need for your pipelines.
      This field is used to store the content of the service account
      JSON file. It can be encoded using base64 instead of messing with JSON format.
      To get the encoded credential, run
      $ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create application_default_credentials.json --iam-account [your-service-account] && cat application_default_credentials.json | base64
      It is recommended to use google cloud shell, which saves you the effort of environment setup.
      Then you can copy-paste the generated token into this field. Note: the token is without spaces/breaklines.

  managedstorage.enabled:
    type: boolean
    title: Use managed storage
    description: |-
      Use Cloud SQL and GCS for storing the data.
      Using CloudSQL and GCS provides better reliability and performance,
      as well as features such as data backup and usage monitoring.
      This is the recommended option especially for production scenarios.
      If false, the data will be stored in GCE Persistent Disk.
    default: false
  managedstorage.cloudsqlInstanceConnectionName:
    type: string
    title: CloudSQL instance connection name (Managed storage only)
    description: |-
      Provide a pre-created CloudSQL for MySQL instance.
      The instance connection name can be found in the instance detail page.
      For example myproject:us-central1:myinstance.
      For more details on how to create a new instance, visit https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/quickstart
  managedstorage.dbUsername:
    type: string
    title: Database username (Managed storage only)
    description: |-
      The database username to connect to the CloudSQL instance.
      If leaving this field empty, the deployment will use the default 'root' user account.
      For more details about mysql username, visit https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/users
  managedstorage.dbPassword:
    type: string
    title: Database password (Managed storage only)
    description: |-
      The database password to connect to the CloudSQL instance.
      If leaving this field empty, the deployment will use no password.
  managedstorage.databaseNamePrefix:
    type: string
    title: Database name prefix (Managed storage only)
    description: |-
      The prefix of the database name. Kubeflow Pipelines will create two databases,
      [prefix]_pipeline and [prefix]_metadata.
      Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Start with a letter.
      If the prefix specified is same as an old deployment in the past,
      the deployment will recover from an old deployment.
      If this not specified, the app instance name will be used.
