    "\n",
    "- Write the program that contains your componentâ€™s logic. The program must use files and command-line arguments to pass data to and from the component.\n",
    "- Containerize the program.\n",
    "- Write a component specification in YAML format that describes the component for the Kubeflow Pipelines system.\n",
    "- Use the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK to load your component, use it in a pipeline and run that pipeline.\n",

    "- Train an MNIST model and export it to Google Cloud Storage.\n",
    "- Deploy the exported TensorFlow model on AI Platform Prediction service.\n",
