The `taxi-cab-classification-pipeline.py` sample runs a pipeline with TensorFlow's transform and model-analysis components.

## The dataset

This sample is based on the model-analysis example [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-analysis/tree/master/examples/chicago_taxi).

The sample trains and analyzes a model based on the [Taxi Trips dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew)
released by the City of Chicago.

## Requirements

Preprocessing and model analysis use [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/).

When run with the `cloud` mode (instead of the `local` mode), those steps use [Google Cloud DataFlow](https://beam.apache.org/) for running the Beam pipelines.

Therefore, you must enable the DataFlow API for the given GCP project if you want to use `cloud` as the mode for either preprocessing or analysis. See the [guide to enabling the DataFlow API](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/enable-api).

## Compiling the pipeline template

Follow the guide to [building a pipeline](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/wiki/Build-a-Pipeline) to install the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK, then run the following command to compile the sample Python into a workflow specification. The specification takes the form of a YAML file compressed into a `.tar.gz` file.

```bash
dsl-compile --py taxi-cab-classification-pipeline.py --output taxi-cab-classification-pipeline.tar.gz
```

## Deploying the pipeline

Open the Kubeflow pipelines UI. Create a new pipeline, and then upload the compiled specification (`.tar.gz` file) as a new pipeline template.

The pipeline requires two arguments:

1. The name of a GCP project.
2. An output directory in a Google Cloud Storage bucket, of the form `gs://<BUCKET>/<PATH>`.
