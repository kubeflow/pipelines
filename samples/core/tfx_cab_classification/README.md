The `taxi-cab-classification-pipeline.py` sample runs a pipeline with TensorFlow's transform and model-analysis components.

## The dataset

This sample is based on the model-analysis example 
[here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/tree/master/tfx/examples/chicago_taxi).

The sample trains and analyzes a model based on the 
[Taxi Trips dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew)
released by the City of Chicago.

## Requirements

Preprocessing and model analysis use [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/).

When run with the `cloud` mode (instead of the `local` mode), those steps use [Google Cloud DataFlow](https://beam.apache.org/) for running the Beam pipelines.

Therefore, you must enable the DataFlow API for the given GCP project if you want to use `cloud` as the mode for either preprocessing or analysis. See the [guide to enabling the DataFlow API](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/enable-api).

For On-Premise cluster, you need to create a [Persistent Volume (PV)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) if the [Dynamic Volume Provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/) is not enabled. The capacity of the PV needs at least 1Gi.

## Compiling the pipeline template

Follow the guide to [building a pipeline](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/guides/pipelines/build-pipeline/) to install the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK.

For On-Premise cluster, update the `platform` to `onprem` in `taxi-cab-classification-pipeline.py`.

```bash
sed -i.sedbak s"/platform = 'GCP'/platform = 'onprem'/"  taxi-cab-classification-pipeline.py
```
Then run the following command to compile the sample Python into a workflow specification. The specification takes the form of a YAML file compressed into a `.tar.gz` file.

```bash
dsl-compile --py taxi-cab-classification-pipeline.py --output taxi-cab-classification-pipeline.tar.gz
```

## Deploying the pipeline

Open the Kubeflow pipelines UI. Create a new pipeline, and then upload the compiled specification (`.tar.gz` file) as a new pipeline template.

- GCP
  The pipeline requires two arguments:
  
  1. The name of a GCP project.
  2. An output directory in a Google Cloud Storage bucket, of     the form `gs://<BUCKET>/<PATH>`.
- On-Premise
  For On-Premise cluster, the pipeline will create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), and download 
  automatically the 
  [source data](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/samples/core/tfx_cab_classification/taxi-cab-classification) 
  to the PVC.
  1. The `output` is PVC mount point for the containers, can be set to `/mnt`.
  2. The `project` can be set to `taxi-cab-classification-pipeline-onprem`.
  3. If the PVC mounted to `/mnt`, the value of below parameters need to be set as following:
  - `column-names`: `
/mnt/pipelines/samples/tfx/taxi-cab-classification/column-names.json`
  - `train`: `/mnt/pipelines/samples/tfx/taxi-cab-classification/train.csv`
  -  `evaluation`: `/mnt/pipelines/samples/tfx/taxi-cab-classification/eval.csv`
  -  `preprocess-module`: `/mnt/pipelines/samples/tfx/taxi-cab-classification/preprocessing.py`
