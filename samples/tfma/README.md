This sample runs a pipeline with tensorflow transform and model-analysis components.

## Requirements:

* A GKE cluster with [argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo) and
  [kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow) installed.
  The GKE cluster needs cloud-platform scope. For example:

  `gcloud container clusters create [your-gke-cluster-name] --zone us-central1-a --scopes cloud-platform`

* Preprocessing uses Google Cloud DataFlow. So DataFlow API needs to be enabled for given project.

## The dataset

This sample is based on the model-analysis example [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-analysis/tree/master/examples/chicago_taxi).

The sample trains and analyzes a model based on the [Taxi Trips dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew)
released by the City of Chicago.
