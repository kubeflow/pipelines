## Disclaimer: 
**TFMA DSL is under testing.**

## The requirements:
Preprocessing uses Google Cloud DataFlow. So [DataFlow API](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/enable-api) needs to be enabled for the given project.

## Compile
<!---
Follow [README.md](https://github.com/googleprivate/ml/blob/master/samples/README.md) to install the compiler and 
compile your sample python into workflow yaml.
--->
Currently, the DSL python file is not generated for TFMA yet. You can submit the yaml file directly to the Web UI.

## Deploy
This sample runs a pipeline with tensorflow transform and model-analysis components.
* Prepare output directory  
Create a GCS bucket to store the generated model. Make sure it's in the same project as the ML pipeline deployed above.

```bash
gsutil mb gs://[YOUR_GCS_BUCKET]
```

* Deploy  
Open the ML pipeline UI.  
Kubeflow-training-classification requires two argument:

```
project: MY_GCP_PROJECT
output: gs://[YOUR_GCS_BUCKET]
```


### The dataset

This sample is based on the model-analysis example [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-analysis/tree/master/examples/chicago_taxi).

The sample trains and analyzes a model based on the [Taxi Trips dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew)
released by the City of Chicago.

## Running the sample

```sh
argo submit taxi-cab-classification/pipeline.yaml \
     -p project=MY_GCP_PROJECT \
     -p output="gs://my-bucket/taximodel" \
     --entrypoint kubeflow-training
```
