**Checklist:**
- [ ] Do you want this PR cherry picked to release branch?

    If yes, please either
    * (recommended) ask the approver to add label `cherrypick-approved`, so that release manager
    will handle it in batch
    * or create a cherry pick PR to the release branch after this PR is merged
    (You can refer to [RELEASE.md](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/RELEASE.md#option---git-cherry-pick) for how to do it.)
