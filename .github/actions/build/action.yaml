    # Tags in quay stick around as objects in api, when deleted quay adds "end_ts" time stamp on the tag.
    # To determine a tag is deleted, we need to check for the presence of this tag.
    # Also note there can be multiple tags created/deleted, thus we have 4 cases:
    # Case 1: Only 1 tag was ever created "tags: [{name:..},]"   -- no end_ts field
    # Case 2: No tag was ever created "tags: []"
    # Case 3: >1 tags were created, but they were all deleted at some point [{name:..., end_ts,..},....]  -- note they all have "end_ts" field.
    # Case 4: >1 tags were created, but the most recent one was never deleted (same as case 3, but the latest tag does not have "end_ts".
