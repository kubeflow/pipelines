# Flatten a swagger spec

The toolkit has a command to flatten a swagger specification.

Flattening a specification bundles all remote `$ref` in the main spec document.

Depending on flattening options, additional preprocessing may take place:

- full flattening: replacing all inline complex constructs by a named entry in #/definitions
- expand: replace all $ref's in the document by their expanded content

The default behavior of flatten is to bundles remote refs into definitions and
normalize JSON pointers to definitions.

### Usage

To flatten a specification:

```
Usage:
  swagger [OPTIONS] flatten [flatten-OPTIONS]

expand the remote references in a spec and move inline schemas to definitions, after flattening there are no complex inlined anymore

Application Options:
  -q, --quiet                                                                     silence logs

Help Options:
  -h, --help                                                                      Show this help message

[flatten command options]
          --compact                                                               applies to JSON formated specs. When present, doesn't prettify the json
      -o, --output=                                                               the file to write to
          --format=[yaml|json]                                                    the format for the spec document (default: json)
          --with-expand                                                           expands all $ref's in spec prior to generation (equivalent to --with-flatten=expand)
          --with-flatten=[minimal|full|expand|verbose|noverbose|remove-unused]    flattens all $ref's in spec prior to generation (default: minimal, verbose)
```
